      "body": "GameLook报道/最近关注射击游戏的朋友，大概都有一种感受——“搜打撤”玩法赛道，已经杀到白热化了。\n为什么这么说？光看国内能随时玩到的产品：腾讯手里就有《三角洲行动》《暗区突围》两款重点产品，《三角洲行动》早早实现了3000万DAU，《暗区突围》也突破了1000万DAU——这还没算上《和平精英》DAU超过3700万的“地铁逃生”模式。而这还只是国内。海外市场上，还有像Nexon旗下的《ARC Raiders》以及腾讯海外工作室Sharkmob旗下的《Exoborne》等作品蓄势待发。也就是说，腾讯在“搜打撤”赛道上，至少还握着两张未在国内打出的牌。\n这么一看，这个赛道前排的座位已经被占得差不多了。后来者如果没有点硬实力，恐怕很难挤进去。那么，下一个挑战者会是谁？\n除了大家熟知的《马拉松：失落星船》，最近还真有一个新面孔跳了出来——《绝地求生》（PUBG）的开发商Krafton，在Steam上测试了一款名为《PUBG: Black Budget》（暂译：黑域撤离）的新游戏。有意思的是，它并非在《绝地求生》里增加一个模式，而是一款独立游戏。也就是说Krafton是希望用“搜打撤”玩法，单独打造一条新的产品线。\n要知道，“吃鸡”类游戏的核心流行区域在亚洲，尤其是中国、印度和东南亚。而在中国，《绝地求生》端游本身从未正式获得版号。另一边，腾讯的《和平精英》在今年11月已经申报了PC端版本——考虑到其手游中早已成熟的“地铁逃生”模式，未来国服玩家在手机和电脑上都能玩到自家的“搜打撤”玩法。\n这样一来，Krafton这款《Black Budget》的市场定位就显得有些微妙了。理论上，Krafton的大股东之一是腾讯，其产品进入中国市场时腾讯拥有优先代理权。但腾讯自己旗下已有“亲儿子”（自研产品）和“干儿子”（代理产品）排队等待上线，还有没有必要再引入一个可能和现有产品直接竞争的“表兄弟”？\n从商业逻辑上看，腾讯或许宁愿花些成本把代理权握在手里“雪藏”，也不会让它落入竞争对手手中，给自己制造麻烦。所以，《Black Budget》的国服之路，从一开始就布满了问号。\n抛开市场层面的纠结，游戏本身素质如何呢？遗憾的是，从12月12日开启的封闭Alpha测试来看，玩家反馈几乎可以说是“差评如潮”。\n首先游戏玩法还是“搜打撤”的老一套。《黑域撤离》构建了一个2.5×2.5公里的开放",
