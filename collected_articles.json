Kennedy has been confirmed to appear in Resident Evil: Requiem — via a leaked image on the PlayStation Store.\nThe reveal of new cover art for the game featuring Leon finally puts to bed one of this year's biggest gaming mysteries — something developer Capcom has itself refused to address — just days ahead of Requiem's appearance at The Game Awards. Presumably we'll see Leon announced officially there.\nThis morning, Resident Evil fans began spotting the new cover art appearing on PlayStation 5 consoles in the pre-download screen for owners of the standard (non-Deluxe) version of the game. IGN has now verified this ourselves, and can confirm the image is legitimate. Leon is real.\nThe game's cover shows a stubbled and haggard-looking Leon looming over Requiem's other main protagonist, Grace Ashcroft. In his appearance, Leon looks most similar to his iconic look from Resident Evil 4, his floppy hair set off by a snazzy leather jacket, its collar lined with fur.\nRumors",

      "body": "【GameLook专稿，禁止转载！】\nGameLook报道/12月10日，或许将成为被全球互联网行业铭记的一天——澳大利亚新法案将正式生效，16岁以下青少年用户全面禁止拥有社交媒体账户以及访问社交媒体平台，包括TikTok、Twitter（X）、Facebook、Instagram等全球社交媒体巨头无一幸免。\n很显然，这项法案是聚焦于未成年人保护，避免他们接触社交媒体上的有害内容。考虑到最近两年，全球范围内都在积极推动未成年保护相关法案落地，因此这次澳大利亚首开先河落地了堪称史上最严格的互联网内容管控措施，可能只是一个风向标。事实上目前已经有多国对澳大利亚的新未保政策表示出高度关注，并计划跟进。\n那么为什么社交媒体会成为当下这股席卷全球的未保风潮中，被重点关注的对象？\n常年处于“混沌之地”状态的社交媒体\n关于这次新法案，澳大利亚主管部门可谓是筹划已久，早在去年澳大利亚总理安东尼·阿尔巴尼斯（Albanese）就表示，政府计划对青少年访问社交媒体设定最低年龄限制。\n去年阿尔巴尼斯发布在先驱太阳报的文章\n总理亲自出面盖章也能看出澳大利亚对于管控社交媒体的决心，只不过很多人没想到，澳大利亚会一刀切式地禁止16岁以下用户使用社交媒体。根据法案内容，相关平台必须禁止16岁以下用户注册账户，违规企业将面临最高4950万澳元(约2.3亿人民币)的罚款。\n为什么社交媒体会成为被集火的目标？如果查看禁用产品列表就会发现，被禁止的都是Tik Tok、Twitter这样的广域社交平台，而像Discord这样需要成员申请加入子频道的更加私密的平台，则得到了免除。\n新法案禁止与允许的部分互联网应用\n从以上这些互联网社媒巨头的发展路径来看，社交媒体最开始的定位只是让用户分享个人生活，社交属性是主导。然而随着大数据技术不断发展，广域社交平台纷纷通过算法推荐进行内容分发，社媒平台也变成了一个鱼龙混杂的内容平台。尤其是随着短视频的高速发展，信息传播速度进一步加快，社媒平台内容管理失序的问题也愈发严重。\n有澳大利亚网友就表示，我们对于影视内容行业有清晰的强制性标准，但是“社交媒体仍然是一片充斥着有害内容的混沌之地”。\n还有人表示，当社交媒体只是一个单纯分享个人生活的平台时一切都良好，但是当算法推荐出现以后，社交平台开始变成“一台为了获取用户注意力，而无休止地推送垃圾内容的机器”。\n大数据技术和算法推荐",
